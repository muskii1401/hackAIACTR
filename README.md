<h1> INTRODUCTION </H1>
The sanitary napkin vending machine is a personal hygienic product that turned out as an essential one because it makes young girls to be
stress-free during menstruation, as they can pick the napkins independently and can be changed frequently based on their need.
<h2> IDEA </h2>
We are trying to make an affordable Sanitary Napkin Vending Machine, particularly for our college, which will operate using very basic hardware componentslike Arduino Uno along with the other components like Counter display, lcd, servo motor, connecting wires, switch. This machine will accept coins from users and will provide them with the napkins in return.
<h3> PROBLEM and SOLUTION </h3>
Till now we are not having such machine in our college ,hence we are trying to make them that too at cheap rate. Presently we have used stimulators to show case our idea practically , soon we will be making an IOT device.
<h4> FUNCTIONING OF DEVICE </h4>
