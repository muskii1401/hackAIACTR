<h1> SANI-BUDDY</H1>
SANI-BUDDY (Sanitary Napkin Vanitary Machine) is an affordable approach from our side which will provide sanitary napkin to young girls so that they cab be stress-free during menstruation, as they can pick the napkins independently as an when required (based on their need).
<h2> IDEA BEHIND THIS </h2>
So ,the already existing machines are either very complex and out of the budget for most of the Institutions, hence girls' needs are generally neglected therefore we have come up with this idea particularly for our college which will operate using very basic hardware components like Arduino Uno along with the other components like Counter display,IR, lcd, servo motor, connecting wires, switch. This machine will accept coins from users and will provide them with the napkins in return.
<h2>WORKING AND FEATURES </h2>
It will work similar to the way in what other machines work but just to minimise the cost and make it simpler, we have used basic components which will serve the purpose as well as be efficient in many ways ! 
<br> 1) We have used an LCD(16×2) display which will show the message of insert the coin and will count the amount of money given by the user (i.e the coins)
<br> 2) Since a single coin acceptor can be a bit expensive, hence to avoid its usage, we have used Infrared Pairs (3 pairs for 1Re, 2Rs and 5Rs coins, with each pair having Tx and Rx ). This will detect the movement in each slot and will count the coin and amount likewise. 
<br>3) So, there will be three slots for coins i.e. each slot fir 1Re, 2Rs and 5 Rs coin respectively. Again the purpose of doing all of this is just TO MINIMISE ITS COST SO AS TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE AT EVERY PLACE AS WE CAN.
<br>4) IRs will accept these three types of coins and with the help of switches  and LCD attached, it will make sure that the sum or total amount of all the coins remain 5Rs only, as all our users will get napkins for 5Rs. 
<br>5) Then to again ensure the cost cutting, we have used a servo motor which will rotate 180° and will give a sanitary napkin in return  as soon as the coin reaches the slot and LCD display counts it as  the amount of 5Rs. 

<br> The code and internal functioning of this whole prototype was simulated using TINKERCAD simulator, an AUTODESK Product. Here are some of the images for reference !
