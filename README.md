<h1> SANI-BUDDY</H1>
SANI-BUDDY (Sanitary Napkin Vanitary Machine) is an affordable approach from our side which will provide sanitary napkin to young girls so that they cab be stress-free during menstruation, as they can pick the napkins independently as an when required (based on their need).
<h2> IDEA BEHIND THIS </h2>
So ,the already existing machines are either very complex and out of the budget for most of the Institutions, hence girls' needs are generally neglected therefore we have come up with this idea particularly for our college which will operate using very basic hardware components like Arduino Uno along with the other components like Counter display,IR, lcd, servo motor, connecting wires, switch. This machine will accept coins from users and will provide them with the napkins in return.
